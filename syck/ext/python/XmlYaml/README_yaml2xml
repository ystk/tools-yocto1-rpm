Note: This was copied over into syck from PyYaml, it needs to 
      be updated to use the syck parser, but other than that it
      should work.   Also, this doesn't map directly to what is
      at http://yaml.org/xml.html -- some list discussion and
      eventual resolution would be helpful.  Clark

                   Convert XML to and from YAML
                   ============================


===========
Description
===========

This mini-package contains two implementations of conversion
routines that convert XML to YAML and YAML to XML.  These two
implementations use different canonical representations for XML in
YAML as follows:

convertyaml_map.py uses the following representation:

    The canonical YAML representation of an XML element is a
    dictionary (mapping) containing the following key/value pairs:
        (1) "name" (required) -- a string.
        (2) "attributes" (optional) -- a dictionary (mapping) of name/value
            pairs.
        (3) "text" (optional) -- a string.
        (4) "children" (optional) -- a sequence of dictionaries (mappings).

convertyaml_seq.py uses the following representation:

    The canonical YAML representation of an XML element is a 4-tuple
    (a sequence) containing the following:
        (1) element name
        (2) attributes -- a mapping
        (3) text -- a string
        (4) children -- a sequence of elements

Basically, convertyaml_map.py uses keywords (in a dictionary) to
represent structures and convertyaml_seq.py uses position (within a
list).

There is some usage information at the top of each implementation
file.

Testing
=======

Here are some simple tests:

    python convertyaml_map.py -x2y people.xml
    python convertyaml_map.py -x2y people.xml > people.yml
    python convertyaml_map.py -y2x people.yml

    python convertyaml_seq.py -x2y people.xml
    python convertyaml_seq.py -x2y people.xml > people.yml
    python convertyaml_seq.py -y2x people.yml
